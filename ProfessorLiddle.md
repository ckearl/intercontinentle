## Hi Professor Liddle!

This project was created by Christopher Kearl and Corban Procuniar, and we worked together to make a country trivia game. We started this website several months ago and added to it with this project. Follow the links below to see what the website looked like before and after Project 3:

old website:
oldintercontinentle.corbanpro.net

new website:
intercontinentle.corbanpro.net

### Who wrote what?

We tried our best to keep track of who wrote what code, but before the project started, we worked together on many of the files, so we co-wrote many of the base components. At the top of each file, you'll find a comment that says who wrote the file, and that same information is recorded below.

We did our best to effectily divide the project and have ownership of different components, but we ended up pair programming roughly 80% of the code.
