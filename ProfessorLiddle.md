## Hi Professor Liddle!

This project was created by Christopher Kearl and Corban Procuniar, and we worked together to make a country trivia game. We started this project several months ago and added to it with this project. Follow the links below to see what the website looked like before and after Project 3:

### Who wrote what?

Christopher and I kept track of who wrote what code. Before the project started, we worked together on many of the files, so we co-wrote some of the base components. At the top of each file, you'll find a comment that says who wrote the file. That same information is recorded here:

#### Corban's Files

- src/components/

#### Christopher's Files
